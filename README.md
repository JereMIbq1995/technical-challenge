Technical challenge from ShineSolar

To run the app: <br>

First, run "npm install" to make sure all dependencies are installed.<br>
Then, run the command: <br>
  "npm run start"<br>
from the root folder to start the server.<br>

<span style="color:red;">NOTE: simple running "node app.js" won't work since this won't build the ts and scss files.</span> <br>

The master branch is currently the same as the master branch on "https://github.com/ShineSolar/techinical-challenge.git"<br>

My solution to the challenge is found in the JeremyDuong branch, for which I have created a pull request
