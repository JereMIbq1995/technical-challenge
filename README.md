Technical challenge from ShineSolar

To run the app, run the command: <br>
  "npm run start"<br>
from the root folder.<br>

The master branch is currently the same as the master branch on "https://github.com/ShineSolar/techinical-challenge.git"<br>

My solution to the challenge is found in the JeremyDuong branch, for which I have created a pull request
